Create a timesheet application for employees; each employee should have a reporting manager. The employees should be able to fill out the timesheet. Once the timesheet is filled out, the manager should be able to rate the employee on a scale of 1 to 5. Once the employee has been placed for a particular day, he will not be able to make any changes to the timesheet.
